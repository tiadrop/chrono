# Chrono

Easy, lightweight time library.

Chrono, with its unoriginal but fittingly straightforward name, provides two classes: `TimePeriod`, which represents a length of time, and `TimePoint`, which represents a specific point in time.

## `TimePeriod`

There are many ways to create a `TimePeriod`:

```ts
const oneWeek = new TimePeriod({weeks: 1});
const oneWeek = new TimePeriod({days: 7});
const oneWeek = new TimePeriod({days: 6, hours: 24});
const oneWeek = TimePeriod.weeks(1);
const oneWeek = TimePeriod.days(7);
const oneWeek = TimePeriod.days(6).add({hours: 24});
const oneWeek = TimePeriod.days(6).add(TimePeriod.days(1));
const oneWeek = TimePeriod.days(8).subtract({days: 1});
const oneWeek = TimePeriod.days(1).multiply(7);
// and so on

const somePeriod = new TimePeriod({
    days: 11,
    hours: 10.5
});
```

And as many ways to read one:

```ts
const weeks = oneWeek.asWeeks; // 1
const days = oneWeek.asDays; // 7
const hours = oneWeek.asHours; // 168
// asMinutes, asSeconds, asMilliseconds

const breakdown = somePeriod.breakdown(); // { days: 11, hours: 10, minutes: 30 }
```

### More on `breakdown()`

This function breaks a `TimePeriod` down into meaningful units:

```ts
// specify units:
const breakdown = somePeriod.breakdown(["days", "hours"]);
// ^ { days: 11, hours: 10 }

// retain precision by giving the final unit as float:
const breakdown = somePeriod.breakdown(["days", "hours"], {
    floatLast: true
}); // { days: 11, hours: 10.5 }

// omit units with value 0
const breakdown = TimePeriod.hours(26).breakdown(["days", "hours", "minutes"], {
    includeZero: false,
}); // { days: 1, hours: 2 }

// without specifying units:
const breakdown = somePeriod.breakdown();
const breakdown = somePeriod.breakdown({ includeZero: true });
```

`breakdown()`'s return type depends on specified units and `includeZero` option. With zeros included, its type is `{ [unit]: number }` and with zeros omitted it's `{ [unit]?: number | undefined }`.

![includeZeros: true](./doc/includeZeros-true.png)

![includeZeros: false](./doc/includeZeros-false.png)

When units are not specified, `floatLast` defaults to true and `includeZero` defaults to false and the units days, hours, minutes, seconds and milliseconds are used. When units are specified, `floatLast` defaults to false and `includeZero` defaults to true. The rationale is that the former case, with unspecified units, will therefore provide units as required, without loss of information, while specifiying units should by default yield a specific structure.

`TimePeriod` serialises into JSON as `{ milliseconds: number }` for easy conversion back with, for example, `new TimePeriod(data)`.

## `TimePoint`

There are many ways to create a `TimePoint`:

```ts
// now:
const now = TimePoint.now();
// Date object:
const point = new TimePoint(new Date());
// epoch milliseconds:
const point = new TimePoint(jsDate.getTime());
// epoch TimePeriod:
const point = new TimePoint(TimePeriod.weeks(2652));
// or
const point = TimePoint.epochStart.add({weeks: 2652});
// string:
const point = new TimePoint("2020-10-31 17:30 GMT");
// descriptor object:
const point = new TimePoint({
    year: 2022,
    month: 10,
    day: 31,
    hour: 17,
    minute: 30,
    second: 0,
    timezone: "GMT"
});
// epoch breakdown:
const point = new TimePoint({
    unixEpoch: someTimePeriod.breakdown()
});
```

A TimePoint can be read as a JS `Date` via `timepoint.asDate` or as a unix epoch `TimePeriod` via `timepoint.unixEpoch`.

```ts
console.log("Time passed since 1970-01-01 GMT:", TimePoint.now().unixEpoch.breakdown());
// at time of writing: { days: 19961, hours: 21, minutes: 16, seconds: 44, milliseconds: 228 }
```

`timepoint.add(...period)` accepts a mix of `TimePeriod` and breakdown-like objects:
```ts
const nextWeek = TimePoint.now().add(
    TimePeriod.days(6),
    { hours: 24 }
);
```

`timepoint.subtract(period)` accepts a single value of either of those types.
```ts
const lastWeek = TimePoint.now().subtract({weeks: 1});
const lastWeek = TimePoint.now().subtract(TimePeriod.weeks(1));
```

Use `tp.isBefore()`, `tp.isAfter()` and `tp.equals()` to compare with other points in time, each accepting a `TimePoint | Date` value.

Use `tp.difference(TimePoint | Date)` to determine the period between two times, as a `TimePeriod`.
```ts
const point = new TimePoint("2020-10-31 17:30 GMT");
const elapsed = point.difference(TimePoint.now());
// at time of writing: { days: 1395, hours: 5, minutes: 8, seconds: 37, milliseconds: 203 }
```

`TimePoint` serialises into JSON as `{ unixEpoch: tp.breakdown() }` for easy conversion back with, for example, `new TimePoint(data)`. Casting to string gives the same result as casting an equivalent `Date`, to facilitate immediate compatibility.
